# GMOS_N Mapping of CCD gaps
# Columns are (1) pixel number in dispersion direction, (2) "efficiency"
# The "efficiency" is set to zero in the gaps between the CCDs, otherwise
# it is one.
# Each CCD is 2048 pixels in the dispersion direction, the gaps are 67 pixels.
# The first pixel has number 1.
